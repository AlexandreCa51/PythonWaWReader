# PythonWaWReader
This project is designed to read NASA Perseverance audio, which contains sampling frequency that cannot be processed in VSLM.
Input :
.waw in audio_file = '...wav'
Graphiques
- SPL
- PSD
- 1/3 octave
- Spectrogramme



Cas test : Ingenuity fly 
audio_file = 'audio_heli.wav'
sampling frequency = 100 kH
